# custom-timestamps
A Powercord (or Vizality) plugin that displays custom timestamps on messages.

Either go to #plugin-support in the Powercord Discord server (when using on Powercord) or DM me on Discord for support. 

Issues are welcome, but mostly for feature requests and bugs. Most everything else should go to Discord.
